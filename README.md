# Coding challenge!

Work with index.js - do not edit index.html at all :)

- Create a function called `printr` that takes in an element
- `printr` should console.log the element tag name
- `printr` should then iterate the children that element
- For each child, call the `printr` function
- Finally, call `printr(document.body)` tostart the printing

## DIFFICULT BONUS CHALLENGE

Make printr show its output in `#output` instead of the console. Hint: you might want to collect the elments in and an array and create the elements for them separately.

To challenge yourself **even more**, make the results indented!
